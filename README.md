In the modern banking industry, handling the high volume of credit card applications efficiently is crucial. Traditional manual review processes are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. To address this challenge, I developed an automatic credit card approval predictor using advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Highlights:

Objective: To create a machine learning model that predicts credit card approval outcomes, simulating real-world banking systems.

Algorithms Used: Implemented and compared various models, including:

 @ Logistic Regression
 @ Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
 @ Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
 @ Decision Tree
 @ Random Forest
 @ XGBoost

Outstanding Performance: Achieved an exceptional accuracy of 99.5% using the Decision Tree algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting credit card approvals.

Model Training & Testing: Trained and evaluated multiple models to select the most accurate and reliable one. The chosen model was saved in .pkl format for deployment.

Deployment: Integrated the model with a Flask application, enabling real-time predictions and easy access.

Key Takeaways:

High Accuracy: Achieved a notable 99.5% accuracy with Decision Tree, proving its robustness in credit approval predictions.

Automated System: Developed an automated solution that enhances efficiency and reduces manual errors in the approval process.

Deployment Skills: Gained experience in deploying machine learning models using Flask.

This project has been a significant milestone in applying machine learning to financial applications and achieving remarkable results.
